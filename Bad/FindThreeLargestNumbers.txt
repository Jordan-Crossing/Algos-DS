question
    write a function that takes an array of at least 3 integers and without sorting the input array
    returns a sorted array of the three largest integers in the input array



sample IO
        array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        [2, 3, 4]

edgecase
    must return duplicate integers ie [10, 10, 12] returned from [10, 5, 9, 10, 12]

approach
    declare an array of length 3 called threeLargest
    loop though the input array 
        call an updateLargest function that takes the current number in the array and checks
        if its bigger than any of the values in threeLargest then if it is calls a 
        shiftAndUpdate function
