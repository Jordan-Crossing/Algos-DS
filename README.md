 Lessons learnt through failure and success 

 Im keeping track of attempts to solve questions in notepad 
 related to algorithms and data structures for future reference.

 loss is for code that just doesn't work for the given task wether it be syntax errors, 
 incomplete, or just doesn't pass tests.

 Wins are for code that works although it may still be suboptimal in time or space complexity 
 or otherwise poorly constructed. Saving it allows for perspective as the quality of my
 code improves.
