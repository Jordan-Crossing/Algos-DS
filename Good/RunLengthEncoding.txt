question
    write a function that takes a string and returns its run-length encoding

    run length encoding is when runs of data are stored as a single data value and count, rather
    than as the original run for this problem a run of data is any sequence of consecutive identical characters.
     so "AAA" would be encoded as "3A"

     for claritys sake keep encoding to single digets ie AAAAAAAAAAAA should be 9A3A
sample io
    i= AAABBC

    o= 3A2B1C

edgecase
approach
        store the current run length default to 1
        iterate over the input string  
            if prev character doesnt match current or longer than 9
            push current run length to encodedStringCharacters 
            push previous character
            set run length to 0

        currentRunLength++

        final run logic for last character
